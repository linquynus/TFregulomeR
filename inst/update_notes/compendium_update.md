## Current TFBSs in TFregulomeR compendium v1.1.0
What's new in the version:
1) 92 TFBSs with DNA methylation levels were included from MethMotif
2) Tag fold change values were added for each TF peak set. Tag fold change values were obtained from MACS2 outputs and it measures the fold change of reads in the TF ChIP-seq compared to the control ChIP-seq
3) Re-annotate cell and tissue names.
