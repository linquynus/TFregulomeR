## Current Functionalities v1.0.9
### New features compared to last version v1.0.0 are highlighted  in red color

1) Browse the TFregulomeR data warehouse (TFBSBrowser)
2) Load TF peaks (loadPeaks)
3) Search motif matrix and DNA methylation score matrix (searchMotif)
4) Plot motif or MethMotif logo (plotLogo)
5) Export motif matrix and DNA methylation score matrix (exportMMPFM)
6) Get context-independent peaks along with DNA methylation profiles (commonPeaks & commonPeakResult)
7) Get context-dependent peaks along with DNA methylation profiles (exclusivePeaks & exclusivePeakResult)
8) Form a intersected matrix between two lists of peak sets along with DNA methylation profiles and <span style="color:red">read enrichments</span>, for interactome and co-binding partner studies (intersectPeakMatrix & intersectPeakMatrixResult)
9) <span style="color:red">Automatically generate a PDF report for TF co-factors along with motif sequences, DNA methylation (within motif and in 200bp regions) and read enrichments (cofactorReport).<span>
10) Plot the TFBS distribution in a given list of peak sets (motifDistrib & plotDistrib)
11) Annotate peak genomic locations (genomeAnnotate)
12) Annotate ontologies of target genes by a peak set (greatAnnotate)
13) Convert a motif matrix to a PFMatrix calss object for *TFBSTools* package (toTFBSTools)
