Changes in version 1.2.2 (2020-01-10)
+ Modified the functions intersectPeakMatrix and intersectPeakMatrixResult to allow profiling of users' input external signals during pair-wise comparison analysis.
+ Added a new function interactome3D which could directly generate a dynamic 3D interface report showing TF interactome coupled with CpG methylation and users' input external signal values.

Changes in version 1.2.1 (2019-10-25)
+ Changed the function greatAnnotate which allows to directly use regions in hg38 (rGREAT >= 1.16.1)

Changes in version 1.2.0 (2019-09-06)
+ Changed the function name TFBSBrowser to dataBrowser.
+ More detailed information about motifs, such as consistency with existing database and correlation between different motif callers, added in the output of dataBrowser.
+ Fixed some bugs in function cofactorReport.
+ Added y axis and number of peaks with motif in the output of plotLogo.

Changes in version 1.1.0 (2019-07-25)
+ added read fold changes in the peaks.
+ added function cofactorReport() to automatically generate PDF report for TF cofactors along with motif sequence, DNA methylation and read enrichment.
+ enabled intersectPeakMatrix() to report read enrichment values in the intersected peak regions between list x and list y.

Changes in version 1.0.0 (2019-05-07)
+ stable version released

Changes in version 0.99.0 (2019-01-30)
